# Hi. I'm Robert. (He/Him)

I'm a fullstack software engineer with 8 years of experience who has worked in fields ranging from Game Dev to AgTecH and in search of a new adventure. This is a collection of repos that I used to test out and learn new software and frameworks. Think of this as a junkyard full of art installation. Mind the mess.

## I am currently learning...
- Python, FastAPI, and how the two talk to each other
- C#, .NET, and a refresher on the two after some time away
- Typescript and React, as well as sharpening my UX/UI skills.

 ## I am currently working on...
 - A Godot engine experiement in the form of simple games to get a grasp of the game engine
 - Unreal engine experiements, to expand my skillset
 - A portfolio website because I need one

## I am currently interested in...
- Decentrilization. In a world where our social media sites have become walled off and information is trapped behind logins held by billionares and their mood swings, making everything more accessible everywhere is of great interest of me.
