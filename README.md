Hi. I'm Robert. (He/Him)

If you're reading this, there's a good chance I put this on some application for you company.
I have recently grown tired of my Github being a repository for projects I haven't touched since college and my only commits being work related, so you're gonna see a bunch of weird things pop up here.
The best ways to get to know me are...
 - A: Look at my stars and watches or
 - B: Ask me, I don't bite.
   
Thank you for stopping by, hope to have something interesting here to look at soon.
